## This repo is my take on the Programming language compiler assignment given in PPL Course - HCMUT (SEM 232).
### Assignment 1 :
Lexer:  100/100
Parser: 99/100
-> Parser failed test case fixed in assignment 2. You might want to look aat that part instead.
### Assignment 2 : 100/100
### Assignment 3 : 91/100
### Assignment 4 : 0/100
(Unforturnately I did give up on this assignment. Might come back to this whenever I have time)

### To whoever read this.
If you are looking at this repo I suppose you might study and struggle with HCMUT-CSE PPL Course at the time.

Feel free to that this as a reference for your own assignments. 
HOWVER DO NOT copy it in any circumstance!!!
PLAGIARISM might cost you this course!!!

GOOD LUCK TO Y'ALL AND HAPPY BUILDING YOUR LANGUAGE!!
